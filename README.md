# project-libitina
A Python `print()` write-up of the Project Libitina text and archive of the website. An external archive is also available at http://archive.is/MNW76.

You can run `projectlibitina.py` in Python IDEs such as IDLE or Thonny. Alternatively you can run the script in GNU Bash using `python3 projectlibitina.py`.

If you are in-need of a quick read refer to `projectlibitina.txt`, which has the site's text in plain-text format.
