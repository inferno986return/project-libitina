Sexual Response Test is bypassed during prepubescence.                          
Requested bypassing the following tests:                                        
Third Eye Activation Test; Third Eye Suppression Test; Life Threat Response     
Test; Life Threat Elimination Test.                                             
All requests denied.                                                            

Libitina has not yet recovered from the termination of XXXXXX and is not        
expected to do so in the near future. Continuing to administer these tests will
only accelerate the deterioration of Libitina's health.                         
You are choosing to avoid the measures necessary to prevent a repeat scenario,  
Doctor. Will you not have as much faith in your personnel as you do in your God?
